---

## v0.2.0 - Core UX Fixes ✅
**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Fix critical UX issues and add command palette

### Critical Fixes ✅

**Scrollback Visual Artifacts Fix** ✅
- Fixed with polling approach instead of `tmux attach`
- See `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` for details

### Command Palette (Cmd+K) ✅

**Implemented Features:**
- [x] Fuzzy search via fuse.js
- [x] Jump to sessions with keyboard navigation
- [x] Quick actions (New Terminal, Refresh, Toggle Quick Launch)
- [x] ESC to close, Enter to select
- [x] Cmd+Enter for tool picker

### Project-Aware Session Launching ✅

**4-Phase Implementation Complete:**

1. **Phase 1 - Command Palette:** Fuzzy search across sessions, projects, and actions
2. **Phase 2 - Project Discovery:**
   - Scans configured paths for projects (git, npm, go, rust, python, CLAUDE.md)
   - Frecency scoring (use count × recency multiplier)
   - Config via `[project_discovery]` in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`
3. **Phase 3 - Quick Launch Bar:**
   - Horizontal bar with pinned favorite projects
   - Right-click context menu for remove/edit shortcut
   - Persists to `~/.agent-deck/quick-launch.toml`
4. **Phase 4 - Custom Shortcuts:**
   - Assign keyboard shortcuts to favorites (Cmd+Shift+letter)
   - Conflict detection with reserved system keys
   - Global shortcut handling

**Key Files Added:**
- `frontend/src/CommandPalette.jsx` - Fuzzy search modal
- `frontend/src/ToolPicker.jsx` - Tool selection (Claude/Gemini/OpenCode)
- `frontend/src/QuickLaunchBar.jsx` - Pinned favorites bar
- `frontend/src/ShortcutEditor.jsx` - Custom shortcut recording
- `frontend/src/utils/shortcuts.js` - Shared shortcut formatting
- `frontend/src/utils/tools.js` - Shared tool config
- `project_discovery.go` - Project scanning + frecency
- `quick_launch.go` - Favorites persistence

### UX Improvements

**Session Selector Enhancements:**
- [ ] Show session preview on hover
- [ ] Filter by status (running/idle/waiting)
- [ ] Sort options (recent, name, status)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter)
- [ ] Search/filter sessions inline

**Terminal View:**
- [ ] Status bar (show session name, tool, status)
- [ ] Split pane support (future)
- [ ] Tabs for multiple terminals (future)
- [ ] Better loading states (progress bar)

**Visual Polish:**
- [ ] Smooth animations (fade in/out, slide)
- [ ] Better loading indicators
- [ ] Error messages with actions
- [ ] Tooltips on buttons
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut hints in UI

**Tool Icons:**
- [ ] Change shell icon from `$` to `>` (right caret) - more common representation
- [ ] Replace Claude `C` icon with Anthropic's official Claude logo
- [ ] Consider official logos for Gemini and OpenCode as well

- System tray icon with quick session access
- Auto-attach to last session on startup
- Session templates (pre-configured setups)
- Collaborative sessions (shared tmux)
- AI assistant integration (Claude in sidebar)
- Session analytics (time spent, commands run)
- Backup/restore session configs
- Custom shell integration (session-aware prompt)

## Release Schedule (Tentative)

Assuming prototype validates:

- **v0.1.0** - Prototype (current)
- **v0.2.0** - Command Palette (2-3 weeks)
- **v0.3.0** - Remote Sessions (3-4 weeks)
- **v0.4.0** - Session Management (2-3 weeks)
- **v0.5.0** - MCP Management (2 weeks)
- **v0.6.0+** - TBD based on feedback

## Decision Log

**Why Wails over Electron?**
- Smaller binary size (~5MB vs ~150MB)
- Native performance (Go backend)
- Better terminal integration
- Faster startup time

**Why xterm.js?**
- Industry standard (VSCode, Hyper, etc.)
- Excellent addon ecosystem
- Active development
- Full ANSI/VT support

**Why not native macOS app?**
- Cross-platform potential (Linux, Windows)
- Web tech for UI is faster to iterate
- Easier to find contributors

**Why tmux integration vs direct shell?**
- Session persistence
- Leverage existing Agent Deck infrastructure
- Familiar to power users
- Window management (future splits)
